The Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is a statistical modeling technique used to analyze complex relationships between variables. It is a comprehensive approach that combines factor analysis, multiple regression analysis, and path analysis. SEM allows researchers to test and validate theoretical models by assessing the direct and indirect relationships among variables, including latent (unobserved) variables. SmartPLS is a software tool widely used for structural equation modeling. It provides a user-friendly interface that facilitates the estimation of complex statistical models, including path models, mediation models, and moderation models. SmartPLS uses a partial least squares (PLS) algorithm, which is well-suited for exploratory research and models with small sample sizes.',
